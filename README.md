The main field optimization code is in `minsec`. First, run
```
meshData = process_surface(verts, faces, Flat=flat, NormalizeArea=area);
```
to generate a surface data structure encoding various basic information about the surface. `flat = true` indicates that the surface is a flat (planar) domain so that the local frames will be chosen to be identical and parallel transport operators will be identity operatorsâ€”useful for visualization of generated sections. The parameters of the minimal section optimization are defined relative to the area of the underlying surface, set by the `area` parameter. To compute a minimal section, run
```
[S, C, f, z, admmData] = minsec(meshData, N, lambda, degree, fiberRadius, options, vizOpts);
```
where:
- `N` is the number of discrete subdivisions of the fiber. We find `N = 64` to be a suitable choice for most surfaces.
- `lambda` is the regularization weight on the mass norm of the singular measure, denoted $\lambda$ in the paper. Increasing it will penalize proliferation of singularities.
- `degree` is the degree of the bundle. E.g., set `degree = 1` for unit vector fields, `degree = 2` for line fields, or `degree = 4` for cross fields.
- `fiberRadius` is the radius of the circular fibers, setting the length scale of the minimal section. This is the parameter $r$ in the paper. At higher values of $r$, the mass norm behaves more like total variation energy, while reducing $r$ makes it behave more like Dirichlet energy.
- `options` includes options for fixing or masking singularities, the maximum number of iterations, and a flag for continuous vs. finite-difference vertical derivatives.
- `vizOpts` includes options for online visualization of the current as it converges, as well as for saving the results to a file.

## Visualization

The `plot` directory includes various functions for visualizing currents, sections, and fields.

- `plot_section_volume` displays a (pseudo-)volume-render of a current (only applicable over flat domains).
- `plot_section` displays polar plots of the magnitude of the current over sampled points on the base surface.
- `plot_fourier_components` plots the Fourier components of the scalar function `f` parametrizing the exact part of a current. The phases are only meaningful on a flat domain.
- `plot_section_surface` displays the graph of an extracted section `z` (only applicable over flat domains).
- `plot_intrinsic_field` plots an extracted section in the manner of a quiver plot.
- `plot_integral_curves` generates and plots the integral curves of an
extracted section `z`.
- `plot_singularities` plots the singularities of an extracted section `z` as spheres.

The `figures` directory includes scripts to generate figures in the paper and render them to files. `faces_experiment` must be invoked before `faces_experiment_figures` or `faces_mesh_figures`. For `wavy_disk_experiment`, the values of `eccentricity` used in the paper are `1` and `0.7`. The `dataset_experiment` script was used to process the dataset from Myles et al. (2014), "Robust Field-aligned Global Parametrization." For the figures using faces from the Basel faces dataset, you will need to download the dataset `model2019_face12.h5` to the `figures/basel_faces` directory.

## Dependencies

Some of the code may require functions from `gptoolbox`. `minsec_cvx` requires the `CVX` convex-optimization toolkit and an interior-point optimizer such as `MOSEK`. The `ext` directory contains adapters to external C++ code from the `Directional` and `Geometry Central` projects. Compilation instructions are provided in the `README.md` in that directory.
